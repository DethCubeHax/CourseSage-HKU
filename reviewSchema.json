school that he would give everyone a snail shell when he met offline because the whole semester was completed online Sorry the question I asked during the gp presentation QA was do you think this course is useful is really humble and funny Hahahaha if you cant answer an academic question you will say that it doesnt matter if you cant answer it I wont deduct points from you Oh its really cute and also a very useful course If you learn it you can really understand most of the structural biology literature without any problem   Basically if there is input there will be output It is really

Personally I feel that it is enough to read the ppt and lecture note after class Because it is an online class it is enough to just type in the chat box for class discussions There will be two to three readings before the tutorial every week and there will be about 50 pages in total but you don\u2019t need to read it word by word too seriously just get the main content individual description paragraphs may need to be read in detail and there are also Five or six questions need to be answered in advance in class There will be a debate at the beginning of the semester and the reading will be replaced with one or two movies in the middle Blue Kite and Sunny Day Answer the questions according to the content of the reading It is recommended to prepare one or two questions in advance in detail The wl will be a little smaller and the tutorial effect is also very good In addition to retelling the content of the reading you can add some of your own opinions It is not necessary to be completely similar to Wang Aihe just dialectical thinking Its best to make Shuang Wang interested in exchanging a few words The final essay is to choose two of the three topics and write an 800 essay Basically you will find the answers from the past tutorial content Before the exam it is recommended to take time to sort it out Essay should be as clear as possible because it is generally a

between animals and humansdifferencesequal rights and other issues since junior high school this course covers many entry points for getting started but there are also many aspects that I have never thought about before such as teachers Ask us Have you noticed that in humans daily language animals are often used to insult or belittle others such as calling others like pigs and enough Students are led to think about why we have taken these things for granted Another example is Why does someone pay compensation to the owner and assume legal responsibility when a pet is killed by a car instead of judging it as manslaughter If it is a minor child who is killed by a car the parents and guardians will definitely need to come forward to clarify the legal issues Why dont animals have the same legal status as people If you list these problems casually you will soon find that life is not equal In other words equality of life is a beautiful doctrine but it is almost impossible to realize it Even if a person eats vegan and does not use fur etc he will inevitably violate the law of harming animals Principles will fall into selfmoral discussion and accountability Perhaps because I am very interested in the subject of this class I enjoyed it a lot although I was expecting a deeper and more intense speculation than it presented the part about philosophylawequal rights in life will come

the middle of the class the first Points can be added for the homework that is answered There are also points for the top performance of the homework If you hate the paper you can leave But there is one thing to say the level of the paper is actually not particularly high After all only the first person to answer each question can add points and no one can add a lot I didn\u2019t add a point to the questions in class also can Compared with the COMP3230 next door it is much friendlier to directly score the whole question according to the ranking 2 I feel that the course structure is well designed The problem is that the professors own research field is too biased Whether it is teaching or assessment he is too biased towards the chapter of convolution and he talked about a lot of extended content including dilated convolution deformable convolution not extensions all test points  but GAN and attention are very simple and the exam is basically not involved It feels like convolution has learned a lot of new things but the others are just the intro level and is this teaching method really friendly to zerobased 3 There are also assessment methods The problem as a course called applied deep learning its application is really too small There are two assignments in total one midterm and one final and the two assignments are basically not difficult It is more hard core and more cuttingedge content but it does not allow you to master these things through the assessment The weekly tutorial is basically a little extension of the tutor Personally I feel that these

penalty The end of the normal semester may be a bit busy because there are four assignments on the same day but this semester has been postponed due to the change to online courses so it has not been too busy The project changed from the last assignment and final of this semester involved the knowledge of binary search tree and thread pool In fact it was the content of the comp class at the beginning of 2 so it was a headache for selfstudy at that time but it did have a lot of theoretical lessons after understanding Great help after all I have already practiced hhh myself When doing

course learns the basic Linux system environment Shell language and Terminal and then learns the CC programming language and advanced programming concepts in C in turn Teaching The course is generally

exercises together but many times the questions do not give much time to think and the lectures are also very rough Most of the time 40 minutes can finish the 2hour tutorial Not a great feeling here The courseware will provide a lot of codes and link resources for learning reference and you can also read textbooks if you have enough energy to learn Type the code with multiple hands and dont panic if you want to use CC programming in the future Evaluation Checkpoint is simple but careful 10 1 is a good opportunity to review what you have learned in class Assignment programming questions will be somewhat difficult and the grammar of the CC part needs to be carefully considered Testcase recommends that you do a few more and you can also use the method taught in the course to write a tool that automatically changes Assignment Group Project is a small terminal based game that two people work together You can try to form a team and think about the theme of the game as soon as you come in the project starts straight away it is also a good experience to cooperate with foreign guys 30 in the final exam I think it is the main place to produce the distinction because everyone has almost full

hundreds of pages of PPT in a week It is recommended to plan the time in advance Learning method If you have time before class you can simply look at the PPT The important thing is that the code

and the second half mainly talks about European integration highly similar to CCGL9050 and also the same teacher Both teachers are Europeans and are very willing to communicate with students The

full Dry goods It was taught by two professors in turn and Auers class was more philosophical At first I was a little suffocated when I didnt get used to his accent   Later after I understood it I found that he really had deep and unique ideas about many things Vogts class contains more information and the speaking speed is quite fast and Vogt is tall and handsome In short this is a course that

second half of the European integration and ideology the lecture is taught by Dr Auer and the tutorial is guided by Dr Parker which is more flexible and profound than the first half of the semester

national identity of a country a research paper 40 is based on the content of the present 2000 words and a take home final 25 is for reading Thinking you can choose what reading to read and what questions to write Alex is really knowledgeable and kindhearted but the lecture ideas are a little bit erratic hahahahaha it is generally easier to understand what he is talking about after reading the reading before class the content of the course focuses more on European history and international politics but does not require a lot of knowledge Reserve because I will analyze from relatively unpopular events I suggest you find another topic for this research paper instead of using the topic that the teacher said to write The topic selection is still very important and it basically took 13 of my time And because there are relatively few people in this class you can always talk to the teacher if you have any questions and you can still get a good turtle if you work hard in the end",

about basic music theory can take it It is a compulsory course for introductory music theory Course content 1 At the beginning you will be taught to recognize staves and scales If you have learned musical instruments it should not be a problem it is relatively simple 2 The understanding and usage of triads and seventh chords The harmony progression of these chords is the key and difficult point There will be more content in this part after the midterm 3 Other music elements such as melody texture structure and motivation with moderate difficulty About the assessment 60 are homework 4 assignments if you are careful you can basically not lose points 30 of the two exams are careful you can also not lose points 10 of the participation is signin so it is relatively easy to get Divided The socalled carefulness means that the inversions and properties of various clefs key signatures and chords are clearly seen before writing In addition the test and homework basically do not involve listening so dont worry if you are worried about your poor sense of music or poor hearing Applicability It is very good for amateurs who want to write songs play music or arrange music and chords It will teach some basic concepts that you should know It is a very useful course Lecturer Joyce Tang she was probably still a graduate student at the time she spoke patiently and well",

second half of the course will return to Hong Kong covering everything from unformed Hong Kong pop music in the 1950s to Chen Guangren a freelance artist born in the 2000s However the characters and time in this course contain more information Therefore the content itself will not be particularly indepth Personally I feel that it is more like watching flowers on horseback There is not much content that can be learned If you want to popularize and recognize early pop music then MUSI2015 can definitely help you The lecturer of this course is a Hong Kong pop music professor but she lectures at a faster speed and falls asleep more easily So you just need to memorize the slides in this class This course has two papers and two exams one for the midterm and one for the final The format of the paper is similar to MUSI1024 but the exam combines slides textbooks and listening The tricky thing about this course is that the listening part is often only played for a few seconds and
